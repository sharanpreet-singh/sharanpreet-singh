# 👨‍🎓 Sharanpreet Singh

**`Learner and Implementer (Analyst, Poet and Photographer)`** 

Hey 👋

I'm a data analytics graduate with working experience in technologies like SQL and Excel to find insights from unstructured data that have helped the companies I have worked for make business decisions. I completed my Masters in Analytics so as to learn more about the field and gain a formal understanding of what the industry needs are. It has helped me become proficient in technologies such as R and Python, and also in developing dashboards using softwares such as Tableau, Power BI and R-Dashboards.
